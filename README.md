# FitnessTracker

## Description

The task this week was to create a Fitness Tracker to allow a user to be able to track their daily workouts by inputing specific information about their workouts and exercises. The benefits of logging and tracking
makes it more likely that the user will reach and surpass their goal. It allows the user to be more efficient with their time and workouts. It lends accountability to the user and their goals. Finally, it allows for easier modifications and shows when and where changes need to be made. The Fitness Tracker is of great importance for any user and will certainly make their life easier and get them on the right track to reaching their ultimate fitness goals!!

## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
